abstract = "Rapidly emerging workloads require rapidly developed chips. The Celerity 16-nm open-source SoC was implemented in nine months using an architectural trifecta to minimize development time: a general-purpose tier comprised of open-source Linux-capable RISC-V cores, a massively parallel tier comprised of a RISC-V tiled manycore array that can be scaled to arbitrary sizes, and a specialization tier that uses high-level synthesis (HLS) to create an algorithmic neural-network accelerator. These tiers are tied together with an efficient heterogeneous remote store programming model on top of a flexible partial global address space memory system."

abstract = "Modern high-level synthesis (HLS) tools greatly reduce the turn-around time of designing and implementing complex FPGA-based accelerators. They also expose various optimization opportunities, which cannot be easily explored at the register-transfer level. With the increasing adoption of the HLS design methodology and continued advances of synthesis optimization, there is a growing need for realistic benchmarks to (1) facilitate comparisons between tools, (2) evaluate and stress-test new synthesis techniques, and (3) establish meaningful performance baselines to track progress of the HLS technology. While several HLS benchmark suites already exist, they are primarily comprised of small textbook-style function kernels, instead of complete and complex applications. To address this limitation, we introduce Rosetta, a realistic benchmark suite for software programmable FPGAs. Designs in Rosetta are fully-developed applications. They are associated with realistic performance constraints, and optimized with advanced features of modern HLS tools. We believe that Rosetta is not only useful for the HLS research community, but can also serve as a set of design tutorials for non-expert HLS users. In this paper we describe the characteristics of our benchmarks and the optimization techniques applied to them. We further report experimental results on an embedded FPGA device as well as a cloud FPGA platform."

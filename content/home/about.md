# Biography


I received my PhD in ECE from Cornell University in May 2020, under
[Professor Zhiru Zhang](www.csl.cornell.edu/~zhiruz).
My graduate research is on hardware acceleration for deep neural networks (DNNs),
with specific focus on DNN quantization, DNN accelerator design, and high-level
synthesis design flows. I am particularly interested in designing DNNs and 
hardware systems in conjunction for greater synergy.

During my graduate career, I interned at Microsoft Research in Redmond, working
with Daniel Lo and Eric Chung on low-precision inference for the 
[Brainwave](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/project/project-brainwave/) project.
I'm now working full time at Microsoft in the AI and Advanced Architectures team.
